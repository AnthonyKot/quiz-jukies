What I added

- Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold.
- Streamberry theme tokens and base CSS.
- Phase 1 components: AppShell, TopBar, Button, TextField, LogoStreamberry.
- Pages: LandingPage and a dedicated PlaybookPage to manually verify components.
- CLI scripts for easy run/build/preview.

Epics (high-level tracks)

- Hosted Multiplayer: Host dashboard → lobby → presenter → results (Mode A).
- Solo Mode: Client-only flow with predefined quiz, start → play → results (Mode B).
- Design System & Playbook: Streamberry theme, reusable components, and /playbook for manual verification.

Refinements (Phase 1 styling pass)

- Distinct button variants:
  - Primary: solid Streamberry red with subtle gradient and strong focus ring.
  - Secondary: elevated surface pill with subtle border.
  - Ghost: minimal text-like with soft hover.
  - Danger: red outline (no fill) to distinguish from primary.
- Top bar: subtle bottom border for separation.
- Inputs: improved focus ring/border for clarity.

Additional visual enhancements

- Card gradients and hover lift for interactive tiles (`.card-interactive`).
- Cinematic section headers with Streamberry red underline (`.section-heading`).
- Added `IconButton` with inline SVG icons (play, next, skip, stop, copy, user) ready to swap for Lucide later.

Phase 2 (UI components)

- Components:
  - QuizCard: interactive tile with title, description, question count.
  - SessionConfigForm: form for timer, points, leaderboard timing, auto-start N (OFF by default), correctness reveal (OFF), PIN length.
- Page:
  - HostDashboardPage (`/host`): lists sample quizzes, highlights selection, shows SessionConfigForm, and a Create Session button (logs to console for now).
- Playbook:
  - Added a Phase 2 section demonstrating cards and a live SessionConfigForm sample.

Phase 3 (Lobby)

- Components:
  - PinDisplay: large 6-digit PIN with copy action.
  - PlayerList: grid of player chips with presence indicator.
  - HostControls: start/end controls with auto-start N input; paired with a sticky BottomBar.
  - BottomBar: sticky container for primary host actions on mobile.
- Page:
  - HostLobbyPage (`/host/:sessionId/lobby`): shows PIN, players (mock), and host controls; includes an “Add mock player” button for manual testing.
- Playbook:
  - Added “Phase 3 — Lobby components” section to verify PinDisplay, PlayerList, and HostControls in isolation.

Phase 4 (Solo Mode — client-only)

- Data:
  - Added `public/quiz.json` sample quiz loaded at runtime.
- Components:
  - AnswerGrid, AnswerCard for solo answering and later reuse.
- Pages/Routes:
  - `/solo` (SoloStartPage): shows quiz info and Start.
  - `/solo/play` (SoloPlayPage): single-player question flow (select to enable Next).
  - `/solo/results` (SoloResultsPage): total score and per-question correctness summary; Restart and Exit.
- Engine:
  - `src/solo/soloEngine.ts`: localStorage-backed state, answer handling, next/finish, results calculation.

Solo deploy readiness (GitHub Pages)

- Base path: Vite `base` uses `VITE_BASE`; router uses `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` so routes work under subpath.
- Static JSON: `SoloStartPage` fetches `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}quiz.json` so it resolves correctly on Pages.
- SPA fallback: `404.html` copied from `index.html` during build (workflow/script) for client-side routing.
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and deploys on push to main/master.
- Commands: `npm run build:pages` for local build with fallback file.

Deployment (GitHub Pages)

- Push to default branch (main/master) to trigger Pages workflow.
- Verify in GitHub → Actions: both build and deploy jobs succeed.
- Enable Pages (one-time): Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.
- Open site:
  - Base: https://AnthonyKot.github.io/quiz-jukies/
  - Solo: https://AnthonyKot.github.io/quiz-jukies/solo
- Troubleshooting:
  - 404 on deep links: ensure `dist/404.html` exists (workflow copies it).
  - Wrong base path: confirm `VITE_BASE=/quiz-jukies/` in workflow; router uses BASE_URL.
  - Private repo: ensure Pages is allowed for your plan or make repo public.

Solo Styling Enhancements

- Components:
  - ProgressBar: horizontal progress indicator for question index.
  - ResultsSummary: compact summary card (score out of total).
  - AnswerCard: improved correctness tints (green for correct option, red tint for chosen incorrect) and optional option-id badge.
- Pages:
  - SoloPlayPage: added ProgressBar and sticky BottomBar with Next/Finish button; improved spacing for mobile.
  - SoloResultsPage: added ResultsSummary header and clearer correctness styling.

How to verify locally

- Install deps: npm install
- Run the dev server: npm run playbook (or npm run dev)
- Open the playbook: http://localhost:5173/playbook
    - Check Buttons: distinct variants (Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Danger outline), sizes, disabled, and full-width.
    - Check TextFields: default vs error.
    - Check Cards & Tiles: hover lift and subtle gradient on interactive cards.
    - Check Icon Buttons: various variants and icons.
    - Check Phase 2 section: sample tiles and a live SessionConfigForm.
    - Check Phase 3 section: PIN display, player list with presence, sticky controls.
- Landing page (for context): http://localhost:5173/
- Host dashboard: http://localhost:5173/host (select a quiz and adjust config; click Create Session to see console log).
- Host lobby: http://localhost:5173/host/demo-session/lobby?pin=123456 (add mock players; try Start/End demo alerts; adjust auto-start N).
- Solo mode:
  - Start: http://localhost:5173/solo (loads quiz.json, press Start).
  - Play: answer each question, then Next/Finish.
  - Results: confirm total score and per-question correctness render; Restart and Exit work.

Fixes

- Playbook import: added missing `SessionConfigForm` import in `src/pages/PlaybookPage.tsx` to resolve the "SessionConfigForm is not defined" error when running the playbook.
- Playbook import: added missing `AnswerCard` import in `src/pages/PlaybookPage.tsx` to resolve TS2304 build error.

- Public assets:
    - public/quiz.json
    - public/quiz.enc (optional when using encryption)

Encryption (optional for Solo)

- Script: `npm run encrypt:quiz` (or `QUIZ_PASSWORD=... npm run encrypt:quiz`).
- Input: `public/quiz.json` → Output: `public/quiz.enc` (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA256 250k iters).
- Runtime: Solo auto-detects `quiz.enc` and asks for a password to unlock; falls back to `quiz.json` if no encrypted file.
- Tip: remove `quiz.json` from deployment if you want only the encrypted payload served.

Repo hygiene

- Added .gitignore for Node/Vite project (ignores node_modules, dist, env files, logs, editor caches).

Next options

- Adjust colors/spacing or button shapes in tailwind.config.js and src/styles/index.css.
- If you want a visual tweak (e.g., different radius or primary shade), tell me and I’ll update the tokens.
- Proceed to Phase 4 (Join flow: JoinForm, WaitingRoom, PlayerPlayPage base) or expand lobby controls (kick player, lock joins) before moving on.
